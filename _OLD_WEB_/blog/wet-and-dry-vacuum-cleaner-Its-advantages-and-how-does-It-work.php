            <li>A vacuum could act as a pump</li>
            <p>Some vacuums can not only suck up the air inside through the hose but their motor can also be used to blow air out through the hose. It can come in handy for blowing up mattresses and pool toys. Even though we don't have much use with that specification, it’s good to know their advantage if a situation arises.</p>

          </ul>


          <h3>How Does Wet And Dry Vacuum Cleaner Work?</h3>
          <p>A wet and dry vacuum cleaner and a canister cleaner work in a similar way. The wet and dry vacuum cleaner is ideal for picking up dry dust, wet spills, and damp patches and is also ideal for heavy-duty jobs. For this, the internal parts of the wet and dry vacuum cleaner are well-insulated and placed separately to reduce the chances of electrocution and damage.</p>

          <p>A wet and dry vacuum cleaner uses a two-bucket technique called the collection tank to store liquid and solid debris individually rather than using the regular vacuum bag. The motor and Collection chamber are the main parts of a wet and dry vacuum cleaner in which the motor is situated on top of the collection chamber.</p>

          <p>The air is drawn through the hose and collection chamber of the vacuum cleaner. The speed increases and creates suction when that air passes through a smaller area. Because this high speed will help in picking up particles and transferring them to the collection tank.</p>

          <p>The vacuum cleaner releases the particles when the air enters a larger collection tank. Air vapor is then exited via the exhaust system after being transferred to the motorized ventilator.</p>
